# Assignment

### Overview
Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to create 1.) a wireframe representation and 2.) a visual design recreation of one of the applications listed below.

### List of Applications
- [LA County Arts Education Collective](https://www.lacountyartsedcollective.org/profile/tool/)
- [OneSoil](https://map.onesoil.ai/)
- [Automatic](https://dashboard.automatic.com/#/demo)

### Instructions
- Start by creating a wireframe; a wireframe is a black and white or grayscale, hyper simplified rendering of an application; the goal is to do as little as possible while successfully communicating functionality and workflow, with the goal of getting early feedback
- Then, try to create a visual design that looks as similar to the actual application as you can get it
- See how far you can get in 2â€“3 hours and then feel free to stop, or keep going if you're having fun
- Using Figma, share your project with Nathan and Jeff (jeff@frankl.org)

### Notes
- You can use a grey rectangle or other placeholder for the map; there is no need to recreate the exact map. This assignment is more interested in the user interface surrounding the map
- Don't worry about replicating logos and other images. But try to replicate colors and components (dropdowns, search inputs, buttons) as closely as you can
- The project you submit should contain one wireframe and one visual design
